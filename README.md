# How to use these files

To use the effects files, you must put it into your DBOG 2.0 client folder when it's unpacked. Once you place it there, use packeditor to repack the obj.pak files using the "Pack Object Export" button! 
As for the font and gui files, simply place them in your copy of the 2.0 client.

Enjoy!
